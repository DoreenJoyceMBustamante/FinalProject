This is a laboratory activity that involves a 5-question multiple choice quiz. In every question, you are presented with 4 possible answers. 
This quiz can be seen at the bottom of the "About" page. When you first load the page, only the first question can be seen. To proceed to the
next, you will need to answer the question before moving on. The correct or incorrect answers are displayed with color indicators: red for incorrect, and green for correct. At the end of the test, your final score is revealed. If you feel the need to take the quiz again, you may
reload the page to restart.
