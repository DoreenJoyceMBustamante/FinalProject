        <h2>What is poverty?</h2>
        <p> Poverty is the state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions. 
        Poverty is said to exist when people lack the means to satisfy their basic needs. In this context, the identification 
        of poor people first requires a determination of what constitutes basic needs. These may be defined as narrowly as 
        “those necessary for survival” or as broadly as “those reflecting the prevailing standard of living in the community.”</p>

        <h2>Why is poverty an issue in the Philippines?</h2>
        <p> Poverty is a significant problem because it involves a lack of resources necessary to meet basic needs, such as food, 
        shelter, and clothing. This deficiency can lead to adverse effects on individuals and society, including poor health, 
        low educational attainment, and increased social instability. Historically, poverty was often seen as inevitable due to 
        limited economic output. However, industrialization has increased productivity, making it possible to raise living 
        standards if resources are redistributed effectively.

        Government policies play a crucial role in addressing poverty. They can influence income distribution through taxation 
        and social welfare programs. For example, higher taxes on luxury goods may disproportionately affect the wealthy, while 
        increased social benefits can support the poor. The debate continues on the extent to which governments should redistribute 
        wealth, balancing the need to alleviate poverty with potential impacts on economic behavior and productivity.

        Redistribution policies aim to increase overall social welfare by ensuring that resources are allocated to those in need, 
        thus reducing severe hardship and improving living standards. These policies can also address market failures, such as 
        providing support to families during periods of high expenditure or aiding regions and industries in decline. </p>
