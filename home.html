    <p id="p1"> It is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing and shelter. 
        Poverty entails more than the lack of income and productive resources to ensure sustainable livelihoods. Its manifestations 
        include hunger and malnutrition, limited access to education and other
        basic services, social discrimination and exclusion as well as the lack of participation in decision-making. 
        Lack of access to basic services, education, employment opportunities, as well as climate change
         all serve to perpetuate poverty. </p>

    <p id="p2">In the Philippines, 18.1% of the population lived below the national poverty line in 2021. In the Philippines, the 
        proportion of employed population below $2.15 purchasing power parity a day in 2023 was 0.2%. For every 1,000 
        babies born in the Philippines in 2022, 27 died before their 5th birthday. overty in the Philippines has been linked to 
        bad governance, corruption, and a political system dominated by political dynasties. The country's poorest 
        provinces are ruled by political dynasties. Natural disasters have exacerbated poverty in the Philippines.</p>

    <p> Poverty in the Philippines is a serious issue caused by many factors. A large number of people live below the poverty line, especially in rural areas 
        where jobs and resources are hard to find. Many work in low-paying, unstable jobs, while barriers to education, like high dropout rates and poor school
        facilities, make it difficult for children to succeed. Access to healthcare is also limited, leading to preventable diseases and malnutrition. Natural 
        disasters, which happen often, disrupt lives and make recovery challenging, trapping families in poverty. Despite some government efforts to help, 
        problems like corruption and poor implementation make it hard to see real progress. To tackle poverty effectively, a combination of strategies 
        focused on economic growth, education, and disaster resilience is needed.</p>
